I have Xfinity, so I know that it's not a bandwidth issue. My torrent uploads are configured correctly with no limits. And there are peers
waiting for them through Rutracker, which as of late has recieved positive reviews,so I don't think that it's a sever issue, but my
upload torrent are stalled. What gives?
